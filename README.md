#Readability

Readability Is a web application that measures the readability of a given piece of text.
I got the Inspiration to build this app from the [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).

This application uses The Coleman-Liau index to output what grade level is needed to understand the text.

You can Watch this application live [here](http://www.mojpm.github.io/readability/).
